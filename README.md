# 🍲 Food Menu Recommendation App

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to provide users with a personalized and satisfying experience when choosing food menus. Leveraging the capabilities of Flutter, we have developed an attractive and responsive user interface, with GetX Flutter enhancing state and navigation management for a seamless user experience.

One of the standout features of this project is the implementation of the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) method. This decision-making approach offers personalized food menu recommendations tailored to user preferences by weighing various criteria, such as taste, price, and popularity. By utilizing SAW, we ensure that users receive the most suitable menu recommendations based on their specific criteria.
